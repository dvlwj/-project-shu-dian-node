What is Shu Dian? Google translate yourself ðŸ˜›. It's just a code name I create, because I am too lazy to put the real name of this project. Actually this project is a assignment test that I got.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To run this project is quite easy, just clone or download. 

Create a new database, for how is database example, you can take a look at `project_directory/mock_files/*.sql`

---logs
----logs file(s) will be generated and stored here
---sessions
----sessions file(s) will be generated and stored here
