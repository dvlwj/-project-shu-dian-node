## About <a name = "about"></a>

What is Shu Dian? Google translate yourself ðŸ˜›. It's just a code name I create, because I am too lazy to put the real name of this project. Actually this project is a assignment test that I got.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To run this project is quite easy, just clone or download. 

Create a new database, for how is database example, you can take a look at `project_directory/mock_files/*.sql`

**There is a bug found, for some case if you open the client side with an account that doesn't have a "to do" data yet will make some error, like a "mysteriously" 2 list of data appear out of no where or sometime the "to do" list will be broken with some exception. Since this issue not appear if the account already have 1 data or more, so please to consider to insert a dummy data directly to SQL db, since this project/repository just for testing purpose.**

And then run :

```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```

Feel free to add new npm command inside `package.json` to suit your own interest.

Too busy to put min. specification, but my development environment when write this project is :

* Node v14.2.0 (for both VueJS client and this Express API package)
* Docker v19.03.8
* MySQL v8.0.20 (Dockernized)

Plese remember this program have a logs and sessions files. So if they are not appear in your project directory, you can try to create both folders manually and re-run the program.

It's should be like this :

```
--project_directory
---others folder
---logs
----logs file(s) will be generated and stored here
---sessions
----sessions file(s) will be generated and stored here
---others files
```
